Welcome to our **Snakes and Ladders** project ‚Äî a modern digital version of the classic board game, built using the React.js framework. This interactive and visually engaging game is designed for **two players**, providing a fun and educational experience that reinforces programming logic, React component architecture, and dynamic UI rendering.

- A 10x10 board layout.
- Alternating turns between two players.
- Dice rolling logic.
- Tracking of player positions.
- A modular and maintainable codebase using React best practices.
